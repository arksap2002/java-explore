1) Input and output
2) Working with % / + - *
3) Transformation number in BigInteger. I can use only 0, 1, 2, 10 or valueOf
4) a = bigint_a and a is not BigInteger (or a + bigint_a)
5) Transformation == in equals
6) Lists (NB: b[a[i]])
7) Don't change length of lists
8) Don't touch for and while (???)
9) Problems with double
10) Integer to BigInteger (in <>= and +-...)
11) += and ++
12) a < b -> a - b < 0 (or not)
